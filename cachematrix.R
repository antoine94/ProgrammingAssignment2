## Here is a set of functions that are used to manage to compute and cache and inversion of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix is a function that create a special matrix that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	m <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
		x <<- y
		m <<- NULL
	}
	get <- function() x
	setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
	getinverse <- function() m
	list(set = set, get = get,
		setinverse = setinverse,
		getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve is a function that compute the inverse of a matrix if it has not already been done, or get the cached version of the inversed matrix if it has already been computed for this matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
	## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
	m <- x$getinverse()
	if(!is.null(m)) {
		message("getting cached data")
		return(m)
	}
	data <- x$get()
	m <- solve(data, ...)
	x$setinverse(m)
	m
}
